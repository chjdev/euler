# Arranged probability
#
# Problem 100
#
# If a box contains twenty-one coloured discs, composed of fifteen blue discs and six red discs, and two discs were
# taken at random, it can be seen that the probability of taking two blue discs, P(BB) = (15/21)Ã—(14/20) = 1/2.
# The next such arrangement, for which there is exactly 50% chance of taking two blue discs at random, is a box
# containing eighty-five blue discs and thirty-five red discs.
# By finding the first arrangement to contain over 10^12 = 1,000,000,000,000 discs in total, determine the number of
# blue discs that the box would contain.

# P(BB) = (B / N) * ((B - 1) / (N - 1)) = 0.5 = B * (B - 1) / N * (N - 1)
# -> B**2 - B = N*(N-1)/2
# -> B**2 - B - N*(N-1)/2 = 0

# quadratic formula:
# ax**2 + bx + c = 0,  x = (-b +- sqrt(b**2 - 4ac))/2a

# -> a = 1, b = -1, c = -N*(N-1)/2

# by using this formula we can find the amount of blue disks necessary for a 50% chance for a given N.
# if this amount is an integer, we have a valid solution.
